For more information please contact Dr. Daniel Cameron (camerd7@mcmaster.ca).

Column headers are as follows (NB there are 18 different "Speed ##" columns:

pp (participant number)
Age (in years)
Gender
Speed ## (movement speed for each the numbered trials from 1-18; VLFs ON or OFF indicated in parentheses)
Move Raw Avg (average movement speed across all trials)
Move Norm Diff (normalized difference in mean movement speed for VLF ON minus VLF OFF)
Avg Text Rat (mean in-concert enjoyment rating, averaged across both VLF ON and OFF)
Rat Norm OFF (normalized mean in-concert enjoyment rating for VLF OFF)
Rat Norm ON (normalized mean in-concert enjoyment rating for VLF ON)
Rat Norm Diff (difference in normalized mean in-concert enjoyment ratings; VLF ON minus VLF OFF)
Years Music ("How many years playing your main musical instument (or singing)?")
Music Hours ("How many hours per week do you currently play?")
Years Dance ("How many years of experience dancing do you have?")
Extraversion (score from the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, or TIPI)
Agreeableness (from TIPI)
Conscientiousness (from TIPI)
Neuroticism (from TIPI)
Openness (to Experience; from TIPI)
Enjoyment (rating: “Overall, how much did you enjoy the music?”)
Body Feel (rating: “Could you feel the music in your body?”)
Sensation (rating: “If so, please describe the sensation”)
Sensation Frequency (rating: “If you felt the music in your body, was it more from low (bass), mid, or high (treble) frequencies?”)
Sensation Compare (rating: “How did the bodily sensations compare to other similar-style concerts you've attended in the past?”)
Movement Rating (rating: “How much did you move along with the music?”)
Sensation Compulsion (rating: “Did the bodily sensations affect your compulsion to move?”)
Sensation Pleasantness (rating: “Were the bodily sensations from the music unpleasant or pleasant?”)
Loudness Preference (rating: “Would you have preferred the music to be quieter or louder?”)
